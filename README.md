# RAG-Based-Question-and-answer-Model
🌍 Climate Change PDF Q&A System 🔍📄
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A system that allows users to ask questions about climate change based on the contents of a PDF document. Using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the system retrieves relevant document chunks and generates detailed, contextual responses using a large language model (LLM).

🚀 Features
📚 PDF-Based Knowledge Retrieval – Extracts and processes text from climate-related PDFs.
🔍 Semantic Search with Embeddings – Uses sentence-transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2) for vector-based document retrieval.
🧠 LLM-Powered Answer Generation – Utilizes Google's FLAN-T5 Large for natural language understanding and response generation.
✅ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Enhances factual accuracy by retrieving relevant document sections before answering.
🔗 Transparent Source Referencing – Displays source page numbers for credibility.
💬 Interactive Chatbot Interface – Supports user queries in a simple, conversational format.
⚙️ Tech Stack
Language Model: Google FLAN-T5 Large (Hugging Face Hub)
Vector Database: DocArrayInMemorySearch for efficient semantic search
Text Processing: LangChain for document chunking and retrieval
Embeddings Model: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
PDF Parsing: PyPDFLoader
Backend: Python, LangChain
📂 How It Works
PDF Loading – The system reads and extracts text from a climate change-related PDF.
Chunking – Splits text into manageable, overlapping chunks for better retrieval.
Embedding & Vector Storage – Converts chunks into vector embeddings for efficient similarity search.
Retrieval & Answer Generation – When a user asks a question, the system:
Finds the top 5 most relevant document sections.
Generates a detailed answer using FLAN-T5 Large.
Displays source document references for verification.
Interactive Q&A – Users can query the system in a chat-like loop.
🛠 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Install Dependencies

🏗 Future Enhancements
🔹 Deploy as a Web App (FastAPI, Streamlit, or Gradio)
🔹 Add Multi-PDF Support for broader document coverage
🔹 Experiment with Larger LLMs (FLAN-T5 XXL, Llama-2)
🔹 Fine-Tune for Domain-Specific Insights
💡 Why This Matters?
Climate change is a complex and critical issue. This system empowers users with a tool to extract insights from scientific reports, policies, and research papers without manually sifting through pages of text. It bridges AI-powered retrieval and human knowledge exploration to make expert-level information accessible and interactive.
